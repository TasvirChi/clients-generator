		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>Borhan API documentation provides information to web
			developers who wish to use Borhan's Application Programming
			Interfaces (APIs). To gain a wider understanding of the Borhan open
			source video platform, please review the Introduction to Borhan
			Platform document.</p>
		<p>
			The Borhan open source video platform exposes its Server API to web
			applications by implementing a standard HTTP POST/GET url-encoded
			requests structure. Borhan server API's, also named Borhan Partner
			Services, are designed to follow <a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer"
				target="_blank">REST</a> principles. The server APIs consist of
			service actions for querying, setting, updating and listing entities
			as well as for activating processes within Borhan open source video
			platform. Service actions are grouped according to the entity type
			they are applied on, and provide all actions relevant to the specific
			entity.
		</p>
		<p>This API documentation provides specific information on:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Borhan Services and their related actions</li>
			<li>Borhan Objects and their related properties</li>
			<li>Borhan Enumerated Types and their values</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			A prerequisite for using Borhan APIs is obtaining Borhan partner
			identifiers, such as Partner ID. Learn more about <a
				href="http://www.borhan.org/how-obtain-partner-identifiers#comment-form"
				target="_blank">obtaining Borhan partner identifiers</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to this documentation, Borhan provides an <a
				href="../testme/" target="_blank">API Test Console
				Application</a>, allowing you to develop applications using the Borhan
			API.
